# Sentiment Analysis using BERT

## Overview

Sentiment Analysis using BERT is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on identifying sentiment from textual data. This project highlights how **context-aware embeddings**â€”generated using BERTâ€”can vastly improve sentiment classification accuracy, especially in handling negations and subtle expressions like *"I didn't like the movie"* or *"The movie was not good."*

### Sample:

## Features

* **Context-Aware Embeddings**: BERT is used to generate contextualized word embeddings that understand the position and meaning of words in full sentences.

* **Custom Classification Head**: The `[CLS]` token output from BERT is passed into a custom **feedforward neural network (768 Ã— 3)** for classifying sentiment into three categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

* **Robust Against Negations**: Unlike traditional models like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word2Vec, BERT embeddings preserve sentence structure and context. This allows the model to correctly classify difficult inputs like:

  * `"I didn't like the movie"` â†’ Negative
  * `"The movie was not good"` â†’ Negative

* **Bidirectional Understanding**: BERTâ€™s bidirectional transformer architecture captures dependencies from both left and right contexts, providing deeper language understanding.
