# Sentiment Analysis using BERT

## Overview

Sentiment Analysis using BERT is a natural language processing project aimed at analyzing the sentiment expressed in textual data. Leveraging the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), this project provides a robust framework for understanding the sentiment of various forms of text, such as customer reviews, social media posts, and more.

## Features

- **Contextual Understanding**: BERT captures the contextual nuances of language, enabling more accurate sentiment analysis by considering the entire sentence rather than individual words.
  
- **Pre-trained Language Model**: BERT is pre-trained on vast amounts of text data, making it adept at understanding sentiment in diverse contexts.
  
- **Bidirectional Attention**: BERT's bidirectional architecture captures dependencies in both left and right contexts of each word, enhancing its ability to comprehend sentiment expressed in text.
  
- **Fine-Tuning Capabilities**: BERT can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data, tailoring its sentiment analysis capabilities to suit specific applications and achieve higher accuracy.
